# What You've Built - Simple Explanation

## 🎯 The Big Picture

You've assembled a **Multi-Agent AI Development Environment** that gives you:

1. **Multiple AI Models** via Claude Code Router
2. **64 Specialized Agents** via Claude Flow  
3. **Real-time Monitoring** via CLI Monitor
4. **Parallel Development** via Git Worktrees
5. **Session Management** via Tmux Orchestrator

## 🛠️ What Each Part Does

### 1. Claude Code Router
**What**: Switches between different AI models based on your task
**Example**: 
- Long context → Gemini
- Quick tasks → Haiku
- Deep thinking → DeepSeek Reasoner
- Default → DeepSeek Chat

### 2. Claude Flow (64 Agents)
**What**: Specialized AI agents for different tasks
**Example Agents**:
- `coder` - Writes code
- `researcher` - Analyzes codebases
- `tester` - Creates tests
- `reviewer` - Reviews code
- `architect` - Designs systems
- Plus 59 more specialized agents!

**Cool Part**: We optimized it to use only 1.2GB RAM instead of 6.4GB

### 3. CLI Monitor
**What**: Shows you what's happening in real-time
**Shows**:
- Which tools are being used
- What agents are active
- Errors and events
- Beautiful charts

### 4. Git Worktrees
**What**: Work on multiple features simultaneously
**Example**:
```bash
wt feature-auth     # Creates new branch + workspace
wt fix-bug-123      # Another parallel workspace
```

## 🚀 How to Use It (Ubuntu)

### Step 1: Get on your Ubuntu server
```bash
ssh your-ubuntu-server
cd claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability
```

### Step 2: Run the setup
```bash
claude /ubuntu-setup
```

### Step 3: Use it!
```bash
# Ask Claude to build something
claude "build me a user authentication system"

# Use specific agents
claude "use the architect agent to design a microservices system"

# See available agents
claude /agents

# Monitor what's happening (in another terminal)
tmux attach -t claude
# Then Ctrl+B, 1 to see monitor
```

## 💡 Real Examples You Can Try

### Example 1: Build a REST API
```bash
claude "create a REST API for a todo app with PostgreSQL"
```

### Example 2: Analyze a Codebase
```bash
claude "analyze this codebase and find security issues"
```

### Example 3: Multi-Agent Task
```bash
claude "I need 3 agents: architect to design, coder to implement, and tester to test a payment system"
```

## 🎮 Simple Controls

- **Start everything**: `./launch.sh`
- **See monitor**: `tmux attach -t claude` then `Ctrl+B, 1`
- **Switch windows**: `Ctrl+B` then window number
- **Detach (keep running)**: `Ctrl+B, D`
- **Stop everything**: `tmux kill-session -t claude`

## 📊 What You'll See

In the monitor, you'll see:
```
🔧 PreToolUse     - Tool about to be used
✅ PostToolUse    - Tool completed
💬 UserPrompt     - Your questions
🔔 Notification   - Status updates
📊 Activity Chart - Visual activity graph
```

## 🎯 The Happy Path

1. **Start**: Run `./launch.sh` on Ubuntu
2. **Work**: Use `claude` command in workspace window
3. **Monitor**: Watch the monitor window to see what's happening
4. **Iterate**: Keep building!

No complex communication systems - just tools working together through simple events and standard interfaces.
