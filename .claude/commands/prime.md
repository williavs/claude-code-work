# Prime: Multi-Agent Codebase Research Command

This command deploys a multi-agent swarm to comprehensively research and analyze your entire codebase.

## Initial Codebase Survey

First, let me get a baseline understanding of your codebase structure:



## Key Areas Analysis

Based on the file survey above, I'm deploying specialized research agents to analyze:

1. **Architecture Agent**: Understanding overall system design and component relationships
2. **Security Agent**: Identifying security patterns, authentication, and potential vulnerabilities  
3. **Performance Agent**: Analyzing performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
4. **Documentation Agent**: Reviewing documentation coverage and quality
5. **Testing Agent**: Evaluating test coverage and testing strategies
6. **Dependencies Agent**: Analyzing dependencies and external integrations

## Follow-up Question

After this initial survey showing **{file_count}** total files across **{directory_count}** directories, I need to know:

**Is there anything specific you want me to focus on or prepare for?**

Examples:
- "Analyze all authentication flows"
- "Focus on the frontend React components" 
- "Review API security and data validation"
- "Understand the database schema and queries"
- "Prepare for scaling to handle 10x traffic"
- "Analyze all TypeScript files for type safety"

Or should I proceed with a comprehensive analysis of all areas?

Please specify your focus, and I'll deploy the appropriate specialist agents to dive deep into those areas using the Task tool for multi-agent coordination.
