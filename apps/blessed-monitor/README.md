- ðŸ”§ **PreToolUse** (Yellow): Tool is about to be used
- âœ… **PostToolUse** (Green): Tool use completed
- ðŸ”” **Notification** (Blue): System notification
- ðŸ›‘ **Stop** (Red): Process stopped

## Architecture

- **src/index.js**: Main application entry point and layout manager
- **src/websocket.js**: WebSocket client with auto-reconnection
- **src/eventStore.js**: Event storage and filtering logic
- **src/components/**: UI components (header, event list, chart, filters, status bar)

## Testing

1. Start the test server:
   ```bash
   npm run test-server
   ```

2. In another terminal, start the monitor:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The test server will send random events every 2 seconds for demonstration purposes.
