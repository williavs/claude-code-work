# Tab Navigation Improvements for Tmux Wizard

## Issues Fixed

1. **Inconsistent Tab Key Handling**
   - Added global Tab handler at screen level for reliable capture
   - Added redundant handler at container level for safety
   - Tab key now properly cycles through all focusable elements

2. **Visual Focus Indicators**
   - Enhanced focus styles for textboxes with bright blue background (#0066ff)
   - Added bold text and yellow borders on focused elements
   - Preset buttons now have green background (#00ff00) when focused
   - All interactive elements have clear, consistent focus states

3. **Focus Management**
   - Improved focus tracking with proper field array management
   - Added logic to skip hidden fields during navigation
   - Textboxes now properly enter input mode when focused via Tab

4. **Tab Navigation in Textboxes**
   - Added Tab/Shift-Tab handlers inside textboxes
   - Tab key now properly exits textbox and moves to next field
   - Values are preserved when tabbing out of textboxes

5. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Proper wrapping from last to first element and vice versa
   - Hidden button skipping (e.g., Back button on first step)
   - Better handling of focus state when nothing is focused

## Navigation Flow

- **Tab**: Move forward through fields
- **Shift+Tab**: Move backward through fields
- **Enter**: Submit current field or activate button
- **Left/Right Arrow**: Navigate between wizard steps (when not in textbox)
- **Escape**: Cancel textbox input or close wizard

## Technical Implementation

1. **Global Tab Handler**: Captures Tab key at screen level before other handlers
2. **Smart Focus Management**: Tracks current focus and manages field array
3. **Textbox Integration**: Special handling for textbox input mode
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear, high-contrast focus indicators
5. **Proper Cleanup**: Removes event handlers when wizard closes

## Testing

To test the wizard navigation:
```bash
node test-wizard.js
```

The navigation should now feel smooth and predictable, similar to standard web forms.
